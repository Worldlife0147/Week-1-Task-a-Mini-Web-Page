    <p>The okapi, often called the forest giraffe, is a captivating animal native to the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which borders Nigeria and shares similar West African ecosystems. I love the okapi for its unique zebra-like stripes on its legs combined with a giraffe-like body, making it a living puzzle of nature that highlights the biodiversity of African forests.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Okapis have an extraordinarily long, prehensile tongue—up to 18 inches long—that they use to strip leaves from branches and even clean their own eyes and ears.</li>
        <li>Despite their striking appearance, okapis are masters of camouflage in the dense rainforest, blending seamlessly with sunlight patterns through their striped legs.</li>
        <li>They are the giraffe's closest living relative, but unlike their taller cousins, okapis thrive in the understory of rainforests and were unknown to Western science until 1901.</li>
    </ul>
